abstract: |
    This paper presents a novel approach to achieve optimistic interoperability between rollups in Layer2s, enabling secure, low-gas, and low-latency transfer of standard assets. Our decentralized architectures prioritize efficiency while effectively monitoring malicious behavior using zero-knowledge proofs. The protocol assumes that the majority of actors are not faulty and optimistically handles cross-rollup events to ensure timely execution. Additionally, it offers a fast and convenient method to detect and monitor malicious events while benefiting from the security inherited from Ethereum Layer1. The operations on the destination side are compatible with both EVM and non-EVM rollup environments.

# PREVIOUS WORK

At present, there are several different cross-chain technical solutions and projects. We can divide them into two categories, one is cross rollups bridge and the other is cross public chains bridge.

The security fundamentals between cross rollups and cross chains are totally different. Assets transferred between rollups, due to the technical characteristics of Rollups, can essentially be considered to remain on the Ethereum mainnet rather than other public chains. Whereas assets transferred between public chains will bear The Bucket Effect. If the weakest chain suffers from  51% attack, the asset's security will also be weakened [@rollupbridgesecurity].

Vitalik Buterin introduced an idea for **Easy Decentralizd Cross-layer-2 Bridge** [@vbeasyl2brdige], outlining a compact architecture for a cross-rollup bridge within the rollup environment. This proposal served as a significant inspiration for the design of Orbiter bridge.

**LayerZero** [@zarick2021layerzero] is a cross chain protocol, its communication's validation requires two independent components, the Oracle and Relayer. The Oracle provides the block header, and the Relayer provides the proof of specific transactions.

**StarGate** [@stargatewhitepaper], a cross chain bridge which is built on the LayerZero protocol. Its $\Delta$ Algorithm enhances the connectivity of asset liquidity between different chains.

**Hop** [@hopwhitepaper] is a previous cross rollup bridge project, it utilizes bridging mechanisms to enable the transfer of assets between different blockchain networks and establishes bridges that lock tokens on one chain and mint wrapped tokens on the destination chain, ensuring interoperability across chains through Automated Market Makers.

**Nomad** [@nomadofficialwebsite] is a previous optimistic interoperability cross-chain protocol that is based on optimistic proofs. It sends data proofs and accepts them as valid after a certain timer expires, while introducing challengers to submit fraud proofs. Nomad spans multiple chains. The sending chain is the source of messages, and messages are committed into the merkle tree. The root of this tree is notarized by the updater, and is relayed to the receiving chain through the relayer in the update. Updates are signed by the updater. They commit to the previous root and a new root. Any chain can maintain a replica contract that contains knowledge of the updater and the current root. Signed updates are held by replicas and accepted after a timeout.

# DESIGN PRINCINPLES
Orbiter Protocol's design follows the flowing principles:

- **Secure.** The priority of security is the highest, primarily focusing on the asset security involved in the protocol layer.
- **Decentralized.** The pledged assets will not be accessed by any role in the agreement, and any malicious behavior will be punished by the mechanism of the protocol layer.
- **Efficiency Sensitive.** High efficiency of fund utilization and gas fees for users during Cross-Rollup execution processes.
- **OmniRollup Compatible.** Assets' interoperability across rollup will be supported in EVM supported rollup and non-EVM rollup networks.

# OVERVIEW

Orbiter aims to build a secure, decentralized and efficiency sensitive cross rollup bridge on Ethereum ecology, and raises the interoperability of the standard assets among these rollup environments. These requirements will dictate the following properties:

- Every transaction that the user interacts with the protocol must be a simple transfer transaction, ETH transaction or ERC20 transaction, rather than interacting with a certain contract of the protocol. The user's Cross-Rollup intention is reflected in the series of numbers at the end of the transfer amount. The rules and constraints of this series of numbers are controlled by the protocol layer, which is Orbiter's smart contract.

- After receiving the user's Cross-Rollup intention, the Cross-Rollup market maker needs to respond to the intention, that is, perform the corresponding operation on the target chain.
- Both users and Cross-Rollup market makers, in the case of sending non-compliant transactions that involve malicious behavior, can prove the legitimacy of their transactions through efficient and low-cost zero-knowledge proofs.

# THE ORBITER PROTOCOL

## Role Defination 

- **User.** Users who utilize the cross-environment interoperability systems.
- **Maker.** Providers who offer Cross-Rollup services.
- **Dealer.** Receives incentives by providing decentralized frontends.
- **Submitter.** Responsible for submitting the root of dealerâ€™s revenue tree.
- **Orbiter DAO.** A transparent and decentralized framework designed for managing and operating projects.

## Orbiter Transactions

The user sends a specific amount of ERC20 or native token to the maker, the amount of which corresponds to the following parts:  

- **Transfer Amounts**: The amount that the user would have needed to cross chain; formally $\mathrm{D_{ta}}$.
- **Trading Fee**: Fees paid to the platform and Maker that is charged as a percentage of the transfer amount; formally $\mathrm{D_{tf}}$.
- **Witholding Fee**: The fee prepaid to Maker to pay the gas fee for the destination network transfer; formally $\mathrm{D_{wf}}$.
- **Destination Chain ID**: The destination rollup network sepcified by the user,$\mathrm{D_{dci}}$, which is maintained uniformly and globally on L1 by the orbiter protocol, $\mathcal{C}$.
- **Dealer ID**: formally $\mathrm{D_{di}}$.
- **EBC ID**: formally $\mathrm{D_{ei}}$.

The source transaction execution time can be verified in source block chain, $\mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{S}}$.

\begin{align*}
\begin{gathered}
    \dot{T}_{S} \equiv (T_{S}, \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{S}}, \dot{M}) \\
    \equiv \mathrm{D_{ta}} + \mathrm{D_{tf}} + \mathrm{D_{wf}} + \mathrm{D_{dci}} + \mathrm{D_{di}} + \mathrm{D_{ei}} \to \mathrm{D} \ \ \land \\
    \mathrm{M_{min}} \leq \mathrm{D_{ta}} \leq \mathrm{M_{max}} \ \ \land \\ 
    \mathrm{D_{dci}} \in \mathcal{C_{M}}  
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

The corresponding constrains of the maker responses for the user are as follows:       

- **Maker Address**: formally $\mathrm{M_{A}}$. for all of the address of the selected maker, formally $\mathcal{M_{A}}$.
- **Supporting Chain List**: formally $\mathcal{C_{M}}$.
- **Supporting Token List**: formally $\mathcal{T_{M}}$.
- **Repay Time**: formally $\mathrm{REPAYTIME}$.
- **Transfer Amount Range**: formally $\mathrm{M_{min}}$, $\mathrm{M_{max}}$.

It can be formally defined as:      

\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    \dot{M} \equiv M(\mathrm{M_{A}},\mathrm{M_{min}},\mathrm{M_{max}},\mathrm{REPAYTIME},\mathcal{C_{M}}, \mathcal{T_{M}} ) \ \ \land \\
    \mathrm{M_{A}} \in \mathcal{M_{A}} \ \ \land \\
    \mathcal{C_{M}} \subset \mathcal{C} \ \ \land \\
    \mathcal{T_{M}} \subset \mathcal{T}
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

![User Transfer Amount Structure](./diagrams/amount-structure.png)

Destination transaction, when Maker perceives that the user sends a transaction to the maker address according to the agreed protocol, it needs to transfer a specific amount to the user's address in the target network within the specified time range, $\mathrm{REPAYTIME}$.

It can be formally defined as:    

\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    \dot{T}_{D} \equiv  (T_{D},\mathrm{REPAYTIME}) \\
    \equiv D_{ta} \ \ \land \\
    \mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{D}} - \mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{S}} \leq \mathrm{REPAYTIME}  
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}



source chain transaction, $T_{S}$, target chain transaction, $T_{D}$

Formally, we can refer to a cross rollup transaction as $\dot{T}$:

$$ \tag{1} \dot{T} \equiv (\dot{T}_{S}, \dot{T}_{D}, \dot{M}) \equiv  (T_{S}, T_{D}, M) $$

## CORE CONTRACT 

All smart contracts below are deployed on the Ethereum mainnet:    

- **MDC**: Maker Deposit Contract, keeping Makers's margin, handling the arbitration for user.

- **EBC**: Event Binding Contract, storing the margin rules and Makers' charging standards.

- **ZK-SPV**: Zero Knowledge Simple Payment Verification. Prove the existence and rationality of Orbiter cross-chain Tx through zero-knowledge proof technology. Existence means that both source transaction and target transaction can be proved on L1 that they actually happened on the corresponding L2, and rationality refers to the ability to prove the user's intention in SrcTx and ensure that the results of the payment made by the maker in DstTx comply with specific rules.

- **FeeManager**: Maintain the information of all Dealers, manage and update the benefits that Dealers get from Makers, and ensure the correctness of revenue status updates through the arbitration penalty mechanism.

- **DaoManager**: Maintain some global parameters of the protocol layer.

## Off Chain Component

- **Maker Client**: Responsible for monitoring and supervising Cross-Rollup behavior on the chain to ensure timely response to users' Cross-Rollup transfer transactions.

- **Submitter Client**: In charge of maintaining the information regarding the allocation of Dealer revenue and ensuring timely updates of the collective information to the chain.

## SECURITY MODEL

Orbiter protocol aims to solve the cross-rollup problems instead of the cross-chain issues. The cross-chain project's primary goal is to ensure the security of transactions between two unique chains and avoid the 51% attack. But the cross-rollup project uses the same Ethereum data layer with each rollup which can naturally prevent the 51% attack. Based on this, Orbiter comes up with a cross-rollup mechanism that can inherit the security of Ethereum L2 [@rollupbridgesecurity].

# ZK-SPV

**SPV.** Simplified Payment Verification, firstly proposed in the BitCoin's whitepaper [@nakamoto2008bitcoin]. It allows a transaction recipient to prove that the sender has control of the source funds of the payment they are offering without downloading the full Blockchain, by utilising the properties of Merkle proofs [@bitcoinwikikspv].

**Data Availability.** Rollup solutions provide a scalable framework for transaction processing off-chain, while data availability mechanisms ensure that the necessary data for verifying and auditing those transactions is accessible and reliably stored. They enable efficient and secure scaling of blockchain networks by offloading transaction processing while maintaining data integrity and transparency.
                 
**ZK-SNARKS.** Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, which is widely used in the blockchain community for its features of privacy and scaling. We currently only talk about the latter.It consists of the following cryptographic primitives:

- $\mathrm{Setup}(1^{\lambda}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Params}$. Given the security paramater $\lambda$, the mapping $e:\mathrm{G_1} \times \mathrm{G_2} \rightarrow \mathrm{G_T}$ is a nondegenerate bilinear pairing. $\mathrm{G_1}, \mathrm{G_2}$ are cyclic groups in prime order $p$, and their generators are $\mathrm{g_1}, \mathrm{g_2}$ respectively, $\mathrm{Params} = (p, \mathrm{G_1}, \mathrm{G_2}, \mathrm{G_T}, \mathrm{g_1}, \mathrm{g_2}, e)$.
- $\mathrm{KeyGen}(\mathrm{Params}, \mathrm{C}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{K}_p, \mathcal{K}_v)$. Given the arithmetic circuit $\mathrm{C}$, convert $\mathrm{C}$ into a polynomial relationship $\mathrm{R}_c$, and then generate the proving key $\mathrm{K}_p$ and verification key $\mathrm{K}_v$.
- $\mathrm{ProofComputation}(\mathrm{K}_p, x, w) \rightarrow \pi$. Given the proving key $\mathrm{K}_p$, the public commitment $x$, and the secret witness $w$, generate a zk proof $\pi$ about $x$ and $w$ through the circuit $\mathrm{C}$.
- $\mathrm{Verification}(\mathrm{K}_v, x, \pi) \rightarrow \mathrm{rlt}$. Given the verification key $\mathrm{K}_v$, public commitment $x$, and zk proof $\pi$, output binary bit $\mathrm{rlt}$; $\mathrm{rlt} = 1$ when the proof is legitimate; otherwise $\mathrm{rlt} = 0$.

**Basic Concept**. There are two types of rollups: optimistic rollups and zk-rollups. Their implementations are quite different, Which also leads to the difference of the respective SPV implementations [@spv_on_eth_l2]. The specifics of each Rollup's SPV implementation will not be discussed in this context. Instead, we will utilize a standardized set of proof primitives to universally represent our SPV components. Reducing the gas consumption of transaction validity proofs by adopting ZK-SNARK cryptographic technology.

## Prove Primitives

The challenger should provide the ZK Proof of the source transaction, for the Exsitence of that.

**Challenge Task**. The challenger should create the challenge task through smart contract firstly , locking the margin of the maker which is challenged , the creating time is $t_{0}$, the challenger should deposit some amount of margin, formally $\mathcal{M}_{C}$ formally

$$
\mathcal{T} \equiv (T_{S}, t_{0})
$$

**Proof Generation**. The proof computation function $\hat{C}$ for user's intention with address $a$: $\mathrm{I_{a}}$ is defined as:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    p^{z1}(\mathrm{I_{a}}) \equiv \hat{C}(T_{S}, \mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{S}}, \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{M_{A}}, \dot{M}, \mathcal{K}_{p1})
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

$\mathcal{K}_{p1}$ is the proving key of the circuit.

**Proof Verification**. To verify a validity proof $p^{z1}$ genenrated by user $a$'s intention, the verification time is $t_{1}$:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    v^{z1}(\mathrm{I_{a}}) \equiv (\hat{V}(p^{z1}(\mathrm{I_{a}}),a,\mathcal{K}_{v1}), t_{1})
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

$v^{z1}$ is the result of verification of a proof ,which would be stored on Ethereum. $\mathcal{K}_{v1}$ is the verification key of the circuit.

$$
\dot{\mathrm{SPV}}(\mathrm{I_{a}}) \equiv \mathrm{SPV}((p,v)^{z1}(\mathrm{I_{a}}))
$$

If the maker has responded to the user $a$'s intention, $\mathrm{R_{a}}$, then the target transaction's proof computation can be formalized as:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    p^{z1}(\mathrm{R_{a}}) \equiv \hat{C}(T_{D}, \mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{D}}, \mathrm{D_{ta}}, \mathrm{M_{A}}, \dot{M}, \mathcal{K}_{p1})
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}
The corresponded verification is, the time is $t_{2}$:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    v^{z1}(\mathrm{R_{a}}) \equiv (\hat{V}(p^{z1}(\mathrm{R_{a}}),a,\mathcal{K}_{v}), t_{2})
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

The mechanism of challenge can be formalized as:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    \mathcal{C}_{hallenge}(\mathrm{I_{a}}) \equiv \dot{\mathrm{SPV}}(\mathrm{I_{a}}) \land \dot{\mathrm{SPV}}(\mathrm{R_{a}})
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

<!-- The winner of the challenge is defined as $\mathcal{W}$

The final adjudication can be formalized as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{A}_{djudication}(\mathrm{I_{a}}) \equiv \left\{
    \begin{aligned} 
\mathcal{W} \to \mathcal{C}_{hallenger} \\
\mathcal{W} \to \mathcal{M}_{aker}
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation} -->

![Arbitration Flow](diagrams/cross-tx-arbitration.png)

# Decentralized incentive frontend

In many decentralized projects, when certain front-end applications undergo scrutiny and are taken offline, it results in users being unable to directly use the decentralized products.

**Motivation.** We designed a set of incentive mechanisms to allow third-party organizations to deploy front-ends that support the Orbiter Cross-Rollup bridge protocol.

Dealers use the dealer id to identify itself, and register its fee rate to the fee manager contract.

## Submitter Consensus Election

Nodes need to pledge part of the funds first to meet the basic requirements of becoming a Submitter. In each epoch, the committee needs to go through a round of consensus elections, and a node needs to be elected among the qualified nodes, and the node is responsible for submitting the current round of income state tree.

**Safety.** The property of the protocol that ensuring that the calculation update of Dealer's income and the pre-stored handling fee of Maker are deducted correctly, and can be accurately associated with each cross-chain transaction.

**Liveness.** The property of the protocol that guaranteeing the timeliness of updating the income status, allowing dealers and makers to withdraw and deposit at any time.


![Submitter Node Election](diagrams/submitter-node-election.png)

The challenge of the submitter node election process is not as severe as that of the POS public chain. During the election process, there is no need to maintain more than $2/3$ of the honest nodes like the PBFT [@castro1999practical] election consensus mechanism. As long as there is one honest node, it can remain active and do malicious behaviors will be reported by other nodes with incentives and let them withdraw from the committee.

## Transaction Mapping

We accurately map cross-chain transactions to L1 blocks through a set of rules, which must satisfy sequentially unique property.
The withdraw time of source chain and target chain is $\mathrm{WT_{S}}$, $\mathrm{WT_{D}}$, the mapping block time can be defined as:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
     f(\dot{T}) = \{\mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{S}} + \mathrm{WT_{S}}, \mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{D}} + \mathrm{WT_{D}}\}_{max} \\ 
    + 1DAY
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

All transactions meeting this condition are guaranteed to be finalized. The Block of L1 with its block number $n$, noted as $\mathrm{B}$, its corresponding block number, $\mathrm{N_{block}}$, and there is a timestamp of this block, noted as $\mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{B}}$, there exesits a constraint
$$
\mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{B_{n}}} \leq f(\dot{T}) < \mathrm{TIMESTAMP_{B_{n+1}}}
$$

Then several cross transactions can be mapped to a specific block on L1
$$
\dot{\mathrm{BT}} \equiv \mathrm{BT_{(n,m)}} \equiv \{\dot{T_1},\dot{T_2},\ldots,\dot{T_m}\} \xrightarrow[]{map} \mathrm{B_n} 
$$

![Cross Rollup Transaction Mapp Rules](diagrams/cross-tx-mapped-rules.png)

## Profit Tree

We use a Merkle tree to represent the income status of all dealers.

The key is hashed from Address, $\mathrm{A}$, Chain Id, $\mathrm{C}$, Token Address, $\mathrm{T_{A}}$:
$$
\mathrm{KEY}(\mathrm{A}) = \mathrm{HASH}(\mathrm{A},\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{T_{A}})
$$

Its amount is $\mathrm{Amt}$, the value is:
$$
\mathrm{VALUE}(\mathrm{A}) = \mathrm{HASH}(\mathrm{KEY}(\mathrm{A}), \mathrm{Amt})
$$

![Dealer Profit Tree Structure](diagrams/dealer-profit-tree.png)

_State Transition_, formally $\mathrm{ST}$:
$$
\dot{\mathrm{ST}} \equiv \mathrm{ST_{(n,n+1)}} \equiv \mathrm{S_{n}} \xrightarrow[\{\dot{T_1},\dot{T_2},\ldots,\dot{T_m}\}]{\mathrm{B_{n+1}}, \mathrm{BT_{(n+1,m)}}} \mathrm{S_{n+1}} 
$$

_State Transition Tree Root_, formally $\mathrm{STR}$, $s$, $e$ represents Start, End:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    \dot{\mathrm{STR}} \equiv \mathrm{STR}(\mathrm{s},\mathrm{e}) \to \{(\mathrm{B_{s}}, \mathrm{S_{s}}), (\mathrm{B_{s+1}}, \mathrm{S_{s+1}}),\ldots, (\mathrm{B_{e}}, \mathrm{S_{e}}) \} \\
    \land \{ \mathrm{ST_{(s-1,s)}}, \mathrm{ST_{(s,s+1)}},\ldots,\mathrm{ST_{(e-1,e)}} \}
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

## Submit Profit Tree

\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    \mathcal{S}_{ubmit}(\mathrm{B_{s}}, \mathrm{B_{e}}, \mathrm{STR_{(s,e)}}, \mathrm{S_{e}})  
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

The submitter finally update state of the balance of all dealers to the Fee Manager Contract.

![Submitter Epoch](diagrams/submitter-epoch.png)

## Challenge Protocol

Once the submitter submits the updated state, a one-hour timeframe is designated as a public challenge period. Within this duration, any individual has the opportunity to challenge the submitter.

### Phase 1: Challenge Initiation

The Challenger initiates the challenge process from Fee Manager contract and pledges a certain margin, at which point the Submitter's margin is also locked and needs to respond to the challenge process

### Phase 2: Bisection on Blocks

Submitter submits the middle block number and status. The $\mathrm{Pair_{m_1}}$ can be verified by Merkel proof.
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    \mathrm{Pair_{m_1}} \equiv (\mathrm{B_{m_1}}, \mathrm{S_{m_1}})  \\ 
    \ \ \land \ m_1=\lfloor (s+e)/2 \rfloor \\ 
    \ \ \land \ \hat{\mathrm{V}}(\mathrm{Pair_{m_1}}, \mathrm{STR_{(s,e)}})
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

Challenger needs to respond to $\mathrm{Pair_{m_1}}$. Now there are two cases:

- If Challenger aggress with Submitter's $\mathrm{Pair_{m_1}}$, the protocol has identified a smaller dispute, $\mathrm{Pair_{m_2}}, m_2= \lfloor (m_1+e)/2 \rfloor$. 
- If Challenger disagrees with Submitter's $\mathrm{Pair_{m_1}}$, the protocol has identified a smaller dispute, $\mathrm{Pair_{m_{2^{\prime}}}}, m_{2^{\prime}} = \lfloor (s+m_1)/2 \rfloor$.

Submitter and Challenger will finally $\mathrm{Pair_f}$ at most $\lceil log_{2}^{e-s} \rceil$ rounds.

### Phase 3: Two-steps Proof

At this time, the Submitter needs to prove the integrity of the $\mathrm{BT_{(f,m)}}$, as well as the proof of the continuous existence of the Pair, $\mathcal{K}_{z2}$ is the proving key of the circuit:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    p^{z2}(f,m) \equiv \hat{C}(\{ \dot{T_1},\ldots,\dot{T_m}\}, \mathrm{B_f},\mathcal{K}_{z2}) \equiv \\ 
    \mathrm{BT}_{(f,m)} \land \mathrm{ST}_{(f-1, f)}  \land \mathrm{ST}_{(f,f+1)}
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

the proof of $\mathrm{BT_{(f,m)}}$ should be verified in a specific time on L1, $\mathcal{K}_{v2}$ is the verification key of the circuit:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    v^{z2}(f,m) \equiv (\hat{V}(p^{z2}(f,m),\mathcal{K}_{v2}), t_{1})
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}

If the Submitter can't provide the proof in a specific time, the winner will be the Challenger.

If the Submitter provide the proof, the Challenger should provide the proof of the lost $\dot{T_l}$,  $\mathcal{K}_{z3}$ is the proving key of the circuit:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    p^{z3}(l) \equiv \hat{C}(\mathrm{B_f},\dot{T_l}, \mathcal{K}_{z3}) \equiv \\ 
    \dot{T_l} \notin \{ \dot{T_1},\ldots,\dot{T_m} \} \\
    \land \ \ \dot{T_l} \xrightarrow[]{map} \mathrm{B_f}
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}
 
The proof of $\dot{T_l}$ should be verified in a specific time, $\mathcal{K}_{v3}$ is the verification key of the circuit:
\begin{align*} 
\begin{gathered}
    v^{z3}(l) \equiv (\hat{V}(p^{z3}(l),\mathcal{K}_{v3}), t_{1})
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}


# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
## Recursive ZKP

Recursive zero-knowledge proofs are still new cryptographic primitives relevant to the Orbiter blockchain use case. As some ZKP use cases as mentioned in some previous section. Currently, computing a ZK proof of a complete transaction is still a very time-consuming task, so it will be a time-consuming linear growth challenge to calculate a batch of transaction lists mapped to a specific block. 

However, we can parallelize the proof of multiple transactions through the technique of recursive proof.   

At the same time, we will use some zk algorithms with higher verification efficiency as the last step of zkp verification on the chain, such as groth16 [@cryptoeprint:2016/260], fflonk [@cryptoeprint:2021/1167], etc.
